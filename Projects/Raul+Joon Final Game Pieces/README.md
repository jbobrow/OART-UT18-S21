The pieces submitter just allow a user to click on a neighboring blink and a white or orange blink would move to this neighboring spot which was clicked. This is the main interaction mechanic of our game. You can double click any blink to turn it white and triple click a blink to turn it orange (is using the click to move with fox). For some reason our files work in the simulator but not IRL. We don't know why.
