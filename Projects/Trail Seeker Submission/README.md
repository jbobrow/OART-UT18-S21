# Project 3 - Trail Seeker

### Description

Bring  as many blinks as you can (at least 12) and a friend to play trail seeker, a fun strategy game where the predator's goal is to try to catch the prey in as few turns as possible.

## Process
- Inspiration
    
    - RS
        -  I personally liked the Predator-Prey Model that Joon was working with since the game possibilities had much more depth rather than Conway's game since the ideas revolving around Conway's game didn't make me as excited as other ideas I heard.

        - Initially the idea was to make a territory control game with a predator prey theme but I did not see how the predator and prey teams could interact in this game. The idea for a strategy movement game then popped into my head and then Joon and I created this game. 
    
    - JL
        - Inspired by the predator - prey model to make a simulation into a game. Originally it was intended to be a territory conquer theme but instead decided to create a brand new rule set based on a tense chasing gameplay between a fox and a rabbit
        
        - We figured that the original idea might be a very complex system to work out and we decided to tune down the idea and manipulate it a little bit so that we will make use of our 2 week worktime.

- Learning, Questions, Notes

    - Got more practice in manipulating INERT, GO, RESOLVE in order to send values.
    
    - Note: For some reason, when you try to reset, it doesn't send to all the blinks at once. I can't really describe it, but you can see it after the fox catches the rabbit and the entire game turns red except for a few spots. Then it takes multiple single clicks to reset all blinks to green. (I = RS)
