# 05-Simulated Systems

Here is Conway's game of life. It works for the most part but there is a weird thing where when you click a blink to turn it on it sometimes behaves with the rules and sometimes not and this clicked blink sometimes does not turn off. Though it works in both places, I found better results in the simulator and its easier to run over and over. In its current state, when the code is run, the blinks randomly decide if they are on or off and you can click to turn on or off.
